In order to develop predictive control algorithms for efficient energy management and monitoring for grid connected photovoltaic systems, accurate and reliable photovoltaic (PV) power forecasts are required. A PV yield prediction system is presented based on an irradiance forecast model and a PV model. The PV power forecast is obtained from the irradiance forecast using the PV model. The proposed irradiance forecast model is based on multiple feed-forward neural networks. The global horizontal irradiance forecast has a mean absolute percentage error of 3.4% on a sunny day and 23% on a cloudy day for Stuttgart. PV power forecasts based on the neural network irradiance forecast have performed much better than the PV power persistence forecast model.
